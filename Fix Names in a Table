Write an SQL query to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

Return the result table ordered by user_id.

Table: Users



user_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the ID and the name of the user. The name consists of only lowercase and uppercase characters.

Example:

Users Table:



Output:


Query : - 

SELECT CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(name,1)),LOWER(RIGHT(name,LENGTH(name)-1))) AS name
FROM Users 
ORDER BY user_id;
